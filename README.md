# DigitalCampus
A digital, interactive representation of the FSU Jena campus inside of your browser.

## Startup
Clone the repository and start a server of your choosing (e.g. ```$ python -m http.server```). Alternatively, you can run ```$ docker compose up```. This makes the app available to port 80. The libraries are loaded from an external source, so no further setup is required.
