# Conventions

## Coordinate system

- x = left/right = -longitude
- y = up/down (may change, because z is up in Blender)
- z = forward/backward = +latitude

- tabs instead of spaces for identation, so every user can set the identation width themselves
- single and multi line comments are fine
- no semicolons, because they are not really required in JavaScript ðŸ˜„. Except somebody really loves them

- named functions probably should have the "function" keyword, while annonymous functions should be lambda expressions

## Automated solution

We can use a plugin like Prettier, and then don't have to worry that much about formatting.
Antonio'd suggest we use a common config, which aligns with the present conventions.
